###SUMMARY

180 rows (30 Subjects with 6 Activities)
68 columns (Subject, Activity, 66 feature means)
Each row represents one observation per activity for 66 feature means
For the features only the variables with -mean or -std from the raw data were used in this analysis 
###VARIABLES AND UNITS

First column is "Subject", and is labeled 1 to 30. Identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample.
Second column is "Activity", and can take the following 6 values
LAYING
SITTING
STANDING
WALKING
WALKING DOWNSTAIRS
WALKING UPSTAIRS
Columns 3 to 68 are means of each feature's means from the raw data
